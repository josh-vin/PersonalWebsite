## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Dependencies
```
npm install --s axios
npm install -s vue-simple-markdown
npm install --s bulma
npm install --save-dev node-sass
npm install --save-dev sass-loader
```
I think --s, -s, & --save-dev are all the same. I also think that by doing that in the project, it saves it in a way that makes it so you won't ever have to do it when cloning this project. :facepalm: :shrug:

### Bulma Overide
See [Configuration Reference](https://versions.bulma.io/0.7.1/documentation/overview/customize/).
